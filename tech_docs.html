      <header class="main-section__header">A high-level definition</header>
      <p class="main-section__text">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
        web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely
        content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is
        probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have
        covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
      <p class="main-section__text">The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example.
        We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
        <code><p>Player 1: Chris</p></code>
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:
        <code>p {
          font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
          letter-spacing: 1px;
          text-transform: uppercase;
          text-align: center;
          border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
          background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
          color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
          box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
          border-radius: 10px;
          padding: 3px 10px;
          display: inline-block;
          cursor: pointer;
        }</code>
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:
        <code>const para = document.querySelector('p');
          para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
          function updateName() {
            let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
            para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
          }</code>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="So_what_can_it_really_do?">
      <header class="main-section__header">So what can it really do?</header>
      <p class="main-section__text">The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow
        you to do things like:
        <ul class="main-section__text-list list">
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store
            that name in a variable called name.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: "
            and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect
            when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            And much more!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language.
        So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.
        APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be
        hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for
        home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out
        the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape,
        find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment,
        or do useful complex things. For example:
        <ul class="main-section__text-list list">
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            The DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML,
            dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page,
            or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            The Geolocation API retrieves geographical information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location
            and plot it on a map.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            The Canvas and WebGL APIs allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics. People are doing some amazing things
            using these web technologies —see Chrome Experiments and webglsamples.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia,
            such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's
            computer (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited just yet. You won't be able to build the next Facebook,
        Google Maps, or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a lot of basics to cover first. And that's
        why you're here — let's move on!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="How_do_you_add_JavaScript_to_your_page?">
      <header class="main-section__header">How do you add JavaScript to your page?</header>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses link elements to apply external
        stylesheets and style elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in
        the world of HTML — the script element. Let's learn how this works.
        <ol class="main-section__text-list list">
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory somewhere sensible.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page
            containing a clickable button.
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing </head> tag:
            <code>script

              // JavaScript goes here

            script</code>
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our script element to make the page do something more interesting —
            add the following code just below the "// JavaScript goes here" line:
            <code>
              document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
                function createParagraph() {
                  let para = document.createElement('p');
                  para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
                  document.body.appendChild(para);
                }

                const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

                for(let i = 0; i < buttons.length ; i++) {
                  buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
                }
              });
            </code>
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button,
            a new paragraph is generated and placed below.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
      <header class="main-section__header">Comments</header>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser,
        and exist simply to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back
        to your code after six months and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often,
        particularly for larger applications. There are two types:
        <ul class="main-section__text-list list">
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g.
            <code>
              // I am a comment
            </code>
          </li>
          <li class="main-section__text-list-item">
            A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g
            <code>
              /*
                I am also
                a comment
              */
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text"></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
      <header class="main-section__header">Summary</header>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've begun with just theory,
        to start getting you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it.
        Along the way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website,
        amongst other things.
      </p>
      <p class="main-section__text">
        JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it in simple steps
        that will make sense going forward. In the next article, we will plunge straight into the practical,
        getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript examples.
